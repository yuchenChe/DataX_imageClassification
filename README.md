# DataX_imageClassification
Neural networks models for multi-label classification problems

# To run CNN model, please do as follows:
1. Download the notebook(Uimage_CNN_new.ipnb) and upload it to your google colab
2. Datasets required to run this code are all in this google drive folder https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ovTl4oRZ2oZXNpOOPFjX1bBYSyNe5HaP?usp=sharing, make sure you can get access to this folder ‘data-x’ and move it to the path /content/drive/My Drive/data-X/ …
3. If you cannot make the folder to the above path, you should manually change all the file paths used in the notebook to your own path
4. Mount google drive to your notebook and run the code

# To run Pre-trained models of VGG etc, please do as follows:
The use of the pretrained models for UImage Photo Classification can be found here:

To run the code:
1.	Download the “VGG etc. ipynb”notebook and upload it to your google colab
2.	Datasets required to run this code are all in this google drive folder https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ovTl4oRZ2oZXNpOOPFjX1bBYSyNe5HaP?usp=sharing, make sure you can get access to this folder ‘data-x’ and move it to the path /content/drive/My Drive/data-X/ …

4.	Mount google drive to your notebook and run the code

# To run the Resnet 18 model, please do as follows:
1. Download the code file we need: code file(including dataloader.py and train.py)
2. Dataset required to run the code is in the training_gallery file, please download it and make sure the data file and code file are on the same folder
3. Open the .py files by Pycharm and install all the packages we need to run the model: torch, torchvision etc
4. Run the train.py to get the model result
